# Fireworks generator

Use this dockerfile to generate the Fireworks file for Reactome. The [fireworks-layout application](https://github.com/reactome-pwp/fireworks-layout) will be run and the resulting files will be saved in `/fireworks/`. This docker build depends on the [neo4j](../neo4j/) image.
